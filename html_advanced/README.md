# Webpage from Scratch - HTML Focus
Welcome to the Advanced side of HTML in the ALU Web Development Repository. In this project, I will be building a webpage from a designer file, starting from scratch with pure HTML.

## Objectives

- Build a well-structured HTML page from scratch.
- Follow the design and layout provided in the Figma file.


### Important Notes

- If the required fonts are not available locally, you can find them here: [source-sans-pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle).

Let's get started!
